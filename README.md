# New site

My new website, I have to use github so I don't lose anymore new sites. I have been making new sites with Foundation, Material UI and other CSS frameworks on react but I forget to upload them to my web server... and then I clean up or format my PC and lose all work.

Yes, this may be the third new site. Hey, at least I am trying Semantic UI. It's meh, like Bootstrap, has a lot of ready stuff, but worse responsiveness, at least Bootstrap still rules responsiveness.
